#T-622-ARTI: Final Project
##Rapidly exploring random trees
In this folder is my final project for the above class at Reykjavik University Spring 2015.
###Running the project
Running this project requires the [Python 3 Interpreter](http://www.python.org/downloads).
The project has [pyglet](http://pyglet.org) as a hard dependency. Install it using pip by using `pip install pyglet`.

Then run the main file using Python 3 `python3 main.py`,
if I've set things correctly you should also be able to run `.\main.py`.

To see the flags you can use follow the executable with the `-h` flag.
