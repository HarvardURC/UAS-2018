#T-622-ARTI: Final Project
##Rapidly exploring random trees
In this folder is my final project for the above class at Reykjavik University Spring 2015.
###Running the project
Running this project requires the [Python 3 Interpreter](http://www.python.org/downloads).
The project has [pyglet](http://pyglet.org) as a hard dependency. Install it using pip by using `pip install pyglet`.

Then run the main file using Python 3 `python3 main.py`,
if I've set things correctly you should also be able to run `.\main.py`.

To see the flags you can use follow the executable with the `-h` flag.

- Will Bryk:
I played around with this code before. It\'92s pretty cool, you could try out different algorithms for getting from the red to the green.

You can place circular obstacles by clicking the screen. Press s to draw the best path. I forget the other controls, but you could find them in the code! I changed the code so that it doesn't create the path iteratively one step at a time, but just jumps to the final path. I would explore the code, it took me a few hours to grasp it, but it makes sense in the end.
